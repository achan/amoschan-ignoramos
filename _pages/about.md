Hi, my name is **Amos Chan**. I'm a developer at [VarageSale][vs], primarily
focusing on their iOS application.

I strive for short feedback loops (minimum viable product and short
iterations). I believe in the initial investment of test-driven development for
a better long-term maintainability of code.

I specialize in full-stack application development: Native iOS development in
Swift, rich client side development with JavaScript (AngularJS/Ember/jQuery)
and server side development with Java, Ruby and Node... using high code
coverage as a tool to improve code quality iteratively.
