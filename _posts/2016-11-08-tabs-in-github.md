As a new convert to tabs in the Tabs vs. Spaces war, my immediate concern was
how my code would look in GitHub 👀. It turns out that GitHub respects the
`.editorconfig` file used by JetBrains, allowing us to set up the default tab
size with the following:

.editorconfig:

    [*.swift]
    indent_style = tab
    indent_size = 2
