After 10 years of web development, I've made the switch to iOS development. [My
employer][vs] graciously took a chance on me and allowed me to switch over with
virtually no iOS expertise.

[vs]: https://www.varagesale.com

I plan to follow a similar blueprint as when I switched from Java to Ruby:

**1) Who should I follow on Twitter?**

I'm currently following a couple iOS development "celebrities," but I'm looking
for accounts that have more of a developer focus. Who are the, for lack of a better word,
"Thought Leaders" of iOS development?

**2) Which Swift/iOS development podcasts discuss best-practices?**

I'm a fan of "[Accidental Tech Podcast][atp]" and "[Core Intuition][ci]," but
they're more about products and less about the implementation.

A couple of iOS development podcasts that I've found recently are [Fatal
Error][fe] and [Runtime][rt].

[atp]: http://atp.fm
[ci]: https://www.coreint.org
[fe]: http://www.fatalerror.fm
[rt]: https://spec.fm/podcasts/runtime

**3) How do I TDD iOS development?**

Coming from Ruby, it immediately struck me how litte documentation, talks and
emphasis in general there is about test-driven development for iOS.

I've found [Quick](https://github.com/Quick/Quick), but I wish there were more
screencasts showing TDD in action. I guess I'll have to explore on my own.

Lastly, I'll be watching [the Standford iOS course][s] at 1.5x speed until
completion ðŸ‘€
