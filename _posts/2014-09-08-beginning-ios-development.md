So I'm just going put this all out in the public and hope it leads to some sort
of accountability on my side... I'm hoping to get into iOS development and I
want to document the journey here.

As of now, I know next to nothing. I've got one app in the App Store, but it's
mainly a `UIWebView` with push notifications. This time, I want to do a fully
native application.

I'll be using [#c25k][c25k] to document this journey. I'll list all the
resources I use, purchase, download. I'll post all the talks I watch and all
the articles I read and I'll be fully transparent and post my earnings as I try
to earn $5000 from the App Store.

Expenses to date:

 - Apple Developer Program: $99

### Total earnings: <span class="balance negative">-$99</span>

Good start so far!
