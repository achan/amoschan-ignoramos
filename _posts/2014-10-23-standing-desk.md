Knowing that I'd be working from home full-time for the next little while, the
first thing I was worried about was the (even more) lack of physical activity I
would be having... it's not inconceivable that I would not leave my house at all
Monday through Friday.

In hopes to improve my sedentary lifestyle, I started looking into using a
standing desk as my day-to-day desk.

I had a couple requirements:

 - **It must be adjustable**: Standing desks are expensive and if I realize
   that standing desks are not for me, I want to at least be able to revert back
   a "regular" desk.
 - **It must be wide**: I have a 3-monitor setup at work that I'm not willing to
   give up, so whatever desk I choose must be able to fit all three.

A quick browse around the net and I quickly realized I had at least one more
requirement:

 - I don't want to spend $800+.

Standing desks are expensive. [Nice ones][updesk] can easily cost more than
$1000... that's not easy to justify when a [typical workdesk from IKEA][galant]
costs just $179.

The cheapest "standing desk" I could find was [VariDesk][varidesk], but it didn't
satisfy my second requirement of supporting three monitors.

One option that I am **extremely** excited about is [Stand Desk][standdesk].
It's a funded Kickstarter that aims to be an affordable, adjustable standing
desk. At $399, I was all...

...until I realized that it was still US-only.

That's when I decided to turn my efforts towards [IKEA Hacks][ihacks]: building
a standing desk out of various IKEA parts.

A couple examples I found were:

In the end, I chose to build my standing desk similar to Rico's from
[MidnightCodr][mc]. I'll talk about why and my slight modifications in Part
2... Stay tuned!
