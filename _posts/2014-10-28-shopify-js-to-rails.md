DOM Hell aside, I think most of the business logic duplication would have been
eliminated if Shopify had a Node back-end. Regardless the choice of back-end,
this problem exists once you want to support multiple front-ends (ie. iOS,
Android and web).

I really think this is the main takeaway of why Rails is a good choice. There's
still no full-stack framework that handles "developer approachability" on its
level.
