If you're anything like me, [reddit][reddit] is more interesting for its
comments than the actual links that are posted. More often than not, I'm
looking in the comments section to hear the different opinions on a given
topic.

[reddit]: http://reddit.com

[#redditcomments][tag] is a series of curated list of comment threads that I
found interesting throughout the day.
