Great talk by Justin Searls about working on a team with different programming
personalities/perspectives, "outside-in development" and really helped put into
words why I enjoy writing *seemingly* unnecessarily small units of code.

It's geared towards the Rails audience (being a Railsconf Keynote) but it's
applicable to development in general.
