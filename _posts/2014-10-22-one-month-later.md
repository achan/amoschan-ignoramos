So a month later I finally have a little bit of progress to report back. I've
been trying to learn the basics of iOS development by watching a couple classes
from the [Stanford iOS 7 courses][stanford]. I didn't end up completing it
because I decided to switch my focus towards Swift.

This led me to watching all the [WWDC videos][wwdc] related to swift. The ones I found
particularly interesting were **Intermediate Swift** and
**Swift Interoperability in Depth**. The latter, in particular, was useful
in teaching me how to use third-party Objective-C libraries with Swift.

Currently, I'm going through [The Complete iOS 8 Course with Swift][course]...
which is an ironic course name since it's still incomplete. What's there is
pretty good. It's aimed towards beginners, so I skipped a lot of the lessons if
the course text didn't show me any new concepts. I don't regret the purchase --
it was $89 when I purchased it -- because it really does provide the basics of
getting an iOS app up and running. One thing that's still missing is Adaptive
Layout, but I'm told that [they'll be added shortly][tweet].
